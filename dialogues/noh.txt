Zeami: Welcome back. I hope your journey hasn’t made you too tired.
I have news for you, child. Starting next year, I’ll be moving to Sado Island.
Player: !!! Wh-what’s the occasion, sir?
Zeami: Per Yoshinori’s orders, I’ve been exiled to the island. He seems not quite the biggest fan of mine.
Player: … But – what’s going to happen to the Kanze troupe then? What will *I* do if my teacher’s gone?
Zeami: Oh, a man’s life has an end, but there is no end in the pursuit of Noh. You, my child, will be fine. 
Player: *You stand there, dazed. After being abandoned by your biological parents, Zeami has basically adopted and trained you this entire time. You can’t imagine a future where he’s not around.*
I’m… I’m not sure I’ll be fine. You say to imitate the objects around me, but who will I imitate when you're gone? Who will tell me about the beauty of flowers and Noh and nag me when I skip practice?
Zeami: *Smiles* You’ll get it soon. There is no such thing as a flower whose petals don’t scatter. But it is precisely these flowers change with the seasons that when spring comes again, we welcome their bloom with open arms. 
Change happens. Nothing is permanent. Rather than running against this current though, it brings much more peace to sway along with it. Understand?
Player: *You nod, although pained.
You start showing your appreciation to Zeami in the only way you know how to – by performing Noh in front of him.*
