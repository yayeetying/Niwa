You found some mountain nuts. You grab it and start munching. As you eat, you remember Dogen's words: 
"When I am hungry, I just eat food. Such simple actions, and yet probably the ordinary person doesnâ€™t share the same sentiment. Because when they eat, they worry about 1000 different matters..."

*Gulp.* That was delicious!
